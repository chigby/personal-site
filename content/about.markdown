About
=====

Cameron Higby-Naquin attended Swarthmore College where he studed
astrophysics and mathematics, and wrote computer programs to determine
the ages and temperatures of stars by comparison to simulations and
models.  He also developed a fondness for making silly web pages and
command line apps, a somewhat unfortunate habit that persists to this
day.

During college, Cameron tried Scottish country dancing, unsure where
it would lead him.  Now, seven years later, he enjoys Scottish,
English, and contra dances, plays traditional dance musinc on the
pennywhistle, and travels up and down the east coast to perform with
the Kingsessing Morris Men and Germantown Country Dancers.  He enjoys
the energetic and the stately, intricate technique and whimsy, and the
feeling of sharing the dance floor with others like him, be it a 200
person hall or a living room with the couches pushed over to the side.

In what spare time he can scrounge, Cameron enjoys strategy and
role-playing games, playing music, cycling and walking, and classic
1920's and 30's pulp.
